    "Eg. Let there are 30 students in a class. They got the marks of thier exams. So to find the mean , mode ,median of thier marks, we can use the discriptive statistics.\n",
    "2) Inferential Statistics: It is used to make conclusion from the data.\n",
    "Eg. Let there are 30 students in a class. They got the marks of thier exams. So to find if the marks of the students in the class is similar to the marks of the students of  school, we can use Inferential Statistics."

    "Ans. Understanding the level of measurement is crucial when analyzing data because it determines the appropriate statistical techniques that can be used, the type of graphs that can be created, and the conclusions that can be drawn. Each level of measurement provides different information about the data and dictates which operations and comparisons are meaningful.\n",

    "\n",
    "If this data is treated as ordinal (which it is), we can use median and mode as measures of central tendency and non-parametric tests like the Mann-Whitney U test for hypothesis testing. Using mean and standard deviation would be inappropriate because the intervals between the ratings are not equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the researcher mistakenly treats this data as interval, they might calculate the mean satisfaction score and apply parametric tests like t-tests. This can be misleading because the difference between ratings (e.g., between 1 and 2 versus 4 and 5) is not necessarily consistent in the customers' perceptions.\n",

    "Ans. Some common measures of central tendency are mean, median and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The sum of all data points divided by the number of data points.\n",

    "Example: In a dataset of test scores [70, 80, 90, 100], the mean is (70 + 80 + 90 + 100) / 4 = 85.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there's an even number of observations, it's the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is a measure of central tendency that is not affected by outliers.\n",
    "Example: In the dataset [70, 80, 90, 100], the median is (80 + 90) / 2 = 85.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode represents the most common value in the dataset.\n",
    "Example: In the dataset [70, 80, 80, 90, 100], the mode is 80.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measure used to find the variability are range, varience and standard deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.The range provides a measure of the spread of the data.\n",
    "Example: In the dataset [70, 80, 90, 100], the range is 100 - 70 = 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "Varience: The average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. Variance measures the spread of data points around the mean.\n",
    "Example: For the dataset [70, 80, 90, 100], if the mean is 85, the variance is [(70-85)² + (80-85)² + (90-85)² + (100-85)²] / 4 = 125.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation:  The square root of the variance. Standard deviation provides a measure of the average distance of data points from the mean.\n",
    "Example: For the dataset [70, 80, 90, 100], if the variance is 125, the standard deviation is √125 ≈ 11.18.\n",
